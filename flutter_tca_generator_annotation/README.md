# flutter_tca_generator

`flutter_tca_generator` is a Flutter library that brings a TCA-like (The Composable Architecture) approach to Flutter apps. It provides an easy-to-use framework for managing state in a declarative and modular way, inspired by TCA from Swift, enabling a clean, predictable, and testable architecture for your Flutter applications.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Split your app into small, reusable pieces (state, actions, reducers).
- **State Management**: Provides a powerful, centralized approach to managing app state.
- **Declarative UI**: Update your UI declaratively based on state, making it easy to manage complex UIs.
- **Testable**: Easily test individual components of your app.

## Installation

Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_tca_generator: ^1.0.0
